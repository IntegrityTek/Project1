        <h5><b>Want to increase your bucking stock’s market value? Enter Super Stakes!</b></h5>
        <p>Then you’ll want to be a part of the Super Stakes Program. This new program provides added incentive for Bucking Stock owners who buck their bulls in ABBI Events. The Super Stakes Program pays cash dividends for money earned by nominated bulls at ABBI-approved events.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Super Stakes Program is the most unique incentive program in the bucking stock industry today. Here are some of the program benefits</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bull calves that are registered in their birth year by December 31 will have the opportunity to enter into the program for only $25.00/head</li>
          <li>As a bull calf gets nominated the sire and dam also gets nominated provided that both sire and dam are verified. </li>
          <li>Super Stakes money is divided and paid annually. Payouts are based on the total number money earned by the bulls at the end of the 2 Year Old Year, 3 Year Old Year and 4 Year Old Year.</li>
          <li>A complete list of nominated calves will be published annually in The American Bucking Bull, Inc. This is an added service to provide potential buyers with the information needed to make informed decisions when buying ABBI registered bulls.</li>
          <li>The calf will be listed as a Super Stake Participant in the registry.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information for Bull and Cow Owners</p>
        <p>This program highlights not only the calf but the dam and sire as well. This is a great way to increase the value of the sire or dam by enrolling their offspring into the program.</p>
        <h5><b>How to Enroll:</b></h5>
        <p>Just enter your calves online or by checking the box for Super Stakes when registering. </p>
        <h5><b>How is the amount of prize money awarded each year determined?</b></h5>
        <p>An ABBI bull has a competition career for three years. Based on that fact, the total money awarded in any year is determined by the amount of bull calf nominations in their birth year and then a percentage will be used for each year of competition.</p>
        <p>The $25.00/head is split up between sire, dam and calf.  As a calf is nominated $15.00 goes into the calf payout, $5.00 goes into the dam payout and $5.00 goes into the sire payout.</p>
        <p>2 Year Old Year - payout is 20% of bull calves nominated in the same birth year</p>
        <p>3 Year Old Year - payout is 30% of bull calves nominated in the same birth year</p>
        <p>4 Year Old Year – payout is 50% of bull calves nominated in the same birth year</p>
        <p>A minimal management fee may be taken out at time of payout.</p>
        <h5><b>Payout</b></h5>
        <p>Payout will occur every year the bull is competing in an ABBI event at the end of the season. Payout will be based on money won. Below is the possible payouts (management fees not excluded).</p>

Previous owner is defined as those who have had the bull in their previous inventory. Any offspring may be grandfathered in as long as they are registered.

      <h4>Any Kid Can Become a Junior Member!</h4>
      <h5>Junior Futurity events are open to Kids age 9-18</h5>
      <p>Welcome to American Bucking Bull's Junior Member page. The bucking bull industry is about more than high scores and winning big. We believe the connections you make and the lessons you learn are the most important things. The friends you make here are friends for life!</p>
      <p>We have many ways of participating in our junior breeder program, from flanking your own bull in our Junior Futurity division to entering our creativity contests. Come and see what ABBI is all about. </p>
      <p>If you do decide to compete at the Futurity level, we offer prizes, awards and trophies. The 2018 Season Winner even earned a trailer from Big Tex!</p>
      <h5>Some of our most FAQ from Junior Members:</h5>
      <h5>Q: What does the average bull weigh?</h5>
      <p>A: The average bucking bull that competes with a rider weighs in at 1,700- 1,800 pounds. The bull very rarely weighs less than 1,200 pounds unless they are competing in the futurities with only a bucking dummy aboard.</p>
      <h5>Q: What is the lifespan of a bucking bull?</h5>
      <p>A: Bucking bulls often live well into their teens, which is considered geriatric for any bull. Though a bucking bull may often be in his prime as an athlete around age 5 or 6, many bulls buck past the age of 10, and when they retire from competition they are used as sires in bucking bull breeding programs.</p>
      <h5>Q: What makes a bull buck?</h5>
      <p>A: The success of bucking bull breeding programs around the world has proven that genetics is the most prevalent factor in determining a bull’s desire and ability to buck. One of the most common misconceptions about bull riding is that the flank strap is tied to the animal’s testicles; this is far from the truth. This is a soft rope that is loosely tied around the bull’s midsection in the flank area and slipped onto the bull when it enters the alley to the chute. The slack is taken out of it before the ride, but not tied too tight, and the strap is removed immediately after the ride. (Todd Dewey, Las Vegas Review Journal).</p>
      <p>It has nothing to do with the genitals, as some uneducated detractors would attest. In fact, care is taken to ensure that the genitals are not involved, as that would adversely affect the performance of the bulls. The flank rope is more of an annoyance than anything else, and the bulls will kick their hind legs out at the height of their bucking action in an effort to dislodge it, resulting in a more uniform and less erratic performance.</p>
      <h5>Q: Where can I find more information?</h5>
